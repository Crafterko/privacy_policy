Privacy Policy for Time Travel Clicker
Last Updated: September 7, 2025

Introduction
This privacy policy applies to the Time Travel Clicker app (the “Application”) for mobile devices, developed by Crafterko (the “Service Provider”). The Application is ad-supported. By using the Application, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

Information Collected by the Game
The Application itself does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information. The only data used internally is a timestamp, which is required for the game to run and is not stored or sent anywhere.

Third-Party Services
The Application uses third-party services, including Google Play Services (https://policies.google.com/privacy) and Unity Ads (https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy). These services may collect data as described in their own privacy policies. The Service Provider does not receive personally identifiable information from these services.

Children’s Privacy
The Application is not directed to children under 13. If a user under 13 downloads the Application, parents or guardians should supervise its use. The Application does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13, and users cannot provide personal information through the Application.

Opt-Out and Data Retention
Since the Application does not collect personal data, there is no data stored by the Service Provider. You can stop any internal data tracking by uninstalling the Application. Third-party services may retain anonymous statistics according to their own policies.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
The Service Provider may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted in the repository with a revised “Last Updated” date. Users are advised to check this file periodically.
